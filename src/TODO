Adam TODO:
 - Merge in Terrence code

Scott TODO:

Vadnal TODO:
 - DeadlineCostScheduler
 - PriorityQueueScheduler

Terence GUI TODO:
 - CPU usage for each node
 - Cost of a node (cents per hour).
 - Ability to change scheduler from console (if logged in as admin)
 - If a job or work_unit is killed, display its kill message (stored in 'kill_msg')
 - Handle errors thrown when adding a job:
 	- On call to grid_url/job, catch HTTPError with code 400 and print out its 'error_msg'
	- On call to grid_url/job/job_id/status, PUTing READY, catch HTTPError with code 400 and print out its 'error_msg'
 - Add a panel which displays the output from scheduler_log.txt

Nice to Have:
 - Properly handle the case of failing to connect to the Node when attempting to send the Task
 - Tidy up the Node Model
 - See if there is some nice Mixin to share code between Tasks, Work Units and Jobs
 - Clean up Scheduler logging to use the logging module
