Terence GUI TODO:
 - Ability to change scheduler from console (if logged in as admin)
 	* I don't think that this is wise to implement from the console,
 	* as it requires that we restart the master node (and therefore
 	* lose all state within the system), and the UI is only designed 
 	* for use by Clients (there is no concept of an Admin role here).
 - [Scott] Client side can already change the scheduler using the command:
    * ./client.py --username admin --password admin -s [SchedulerName]
    * Server already handles the restard and state persistence between 
	* schedulers when switched. Consult further with Adam if you still 
	* disagree.
 - Cost of node currently displayed as $[cost] should be $[cost/100] 
 	per hour
 - Console currently allows multiple executable files to be uploaded. 
 	Consecutive uploads should overwrite previous uploads for executables.
 - Individual work units should also display their kill message if they have one.
    * For example a job can successfully run, but have 1 or more work
	* units killed if they exceed wall_time/deadline.

Nice to Have:
 - Properly handle the case of failing to connect to the Node when attempting to send the Task
 - Tidy up the Node Model
 - See if there is some nice Mixin to share code between Tasks, Work Units and Jobs
 - Clean up Scheduler logging to use the logging module
