Terence GUI TODO:
 - Ability to change scheduler from console (if logged in as admin)
 	* I don't think that this is wise to implement from the console,
 	* as it requires that we restart the master node (and therefore
 	* lose all state within the system), and the UI is only designed 
 	* for use by Clients (there is no concept of an Admin role here).
 - [Scott] Client side can already change the scheduler using the command:
   ./client.py --username admin --password admin -s [SchedulerName]
   Server already handles the restard and state persistence between schedulers when switched.
   Consult further with Adam if you still disagree.


Nice to Have:
 - Properly handle the case of failing to connect to the Node when attempting to send the Task
 - Tidy up the Node Model
 - See if there is some nice Mixin to share code between Tasks, Work Units and Jobs
 - Clean up Scheduler logging to use the logging module
