Nice to Have:
 - Properly handle the case of failing to connect to the Node when attempting to send the Task
 - Tidy up the Node Model
 - See if there is some nice Mixin to share code between Tasks, Work Units and Jobs
 - Clean up Scheduler logging to use the logging module

Known Bugs:
 - [Console] Cancel button isnt binding to the correct job on the console. Will do one of three things:
 	* KILL the correct job
	* KILL a different job
	* Do nothing.
 - [Console] Console isnt detecting which nodes are running jobs correctly. Running work units only appear
    on the first node displayed.
 - [Console] Cancel button should reset the Add Job Column if a job is cancelled before uploading any files
    * and submitting. Or it should be removed until files have been submitted.
