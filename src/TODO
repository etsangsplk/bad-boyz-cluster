Nice to Have:
 - Properly handle the case of failing to connect to the Node when attempting to send the Task
 - Tidy up the Node Model
 - See if there is some nice Mixin to share code between Tasks, Work Units and Jobs
 - Clean up Scheduler logging to use the logging module
 - Kill Scott for his abomination of a WallTime module.

Known Bugs:
 - [Console] Cancel button should reset the Add Job Column if a job is cancelled before uploading any files
    * and submitting. Or it should be removed until files have been submitted.
