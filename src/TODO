Nice to Have:
- Clean up output files on Node once they have been sent to the Server
- Properly handle the case of failing to connect to the Node when
attempting to send the Task
- Tidy up the Node Model
- See if there is some nice Mixin to share code between Tasks, Work Units and Jobs
- Clean up Scheduler logging to use the logging module
