Execution instructions:

See:
 ./client --help
 ./server --help
 ./node --help

Console can be accessed from a browser on the same hostname and port as the 
server is running on.

Only one node should run per machine. If you want to run multiple nodes you 
must move into a new folder and run from there.

node.py
gridservice/*
gridservice/node/*

Demo scripts have been included to demonstrate functionality of algorithms. See:
demos/README

The scheduler log is useful to see the performance of the algorithms. 
Run this command once the server has started:
tail -f scheduler_log.txt
