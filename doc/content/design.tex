The Master - The Scheduler
The Node - The Heartbeat - The Monitor
The Client

A job has 3 various states throughout The Grid. On The Master it exists both as a Job, and as a number of Work Units which exist as part of a Job. A work unit is a pairing of the executable for a job and one input file. In the case of a job with 5 input files, it will have 5 work units, each corresponding to one input file. The level of granularity handled by The Scheduler is a single Work Unit.
