\chapter{Summary and Conclusions}
Existing services for development on the cloud provide a wide range of solutions for different needs. These allow developers to effectively and efficiently develop distributed applications on the cloud using mature development platforms to deploy on their own systems, globally networked high-performance infrastructure, or a combination of both. Use of these cloud based services has been successful for a number of commercial applications, on each of the examined systems.
