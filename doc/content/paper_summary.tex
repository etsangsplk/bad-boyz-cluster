\chapter{Summary and Conclusions}
Existing services for development on the cloud provide a wide range of
solutions for different needs. These allow developers to effectively and
efficiently develop distributed applications on the cloud using mature
development platforms to deploy on their own systems, globally networked
high-performance infrastructure, or a combination of both. The integration and
usage of these cloud based services has been successful for a number of
commercial applications. These successes were documented for each of the
examined systems in this report including Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure,
Amazon EC2 and Manjrasoft Aneka.

None of the services covered are ideal in all circumstances, and the best
system will differ based on the application that needs to be developed and
deployed on the cloud. Google App Engine and Microsoft Azure offer specific
Platforms for the quick development of applications best suited to their
respective environments. Amazon EC2 provides the most flexibility to
developers and organisations in terms of
being cross-platform compatible, while Manjrasoft's Aneka aims to allow for
smaller scale projects that involve a more straightforward development of an
application on a cloud-based service.
