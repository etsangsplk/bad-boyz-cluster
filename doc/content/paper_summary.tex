\chapter{Summary and Conclusions}
Existing services for development on the cloud provide a wide range of solutions for different needs. These allow developers to effectively and efficiently develop distributed applications on the cloud using mature development platforms to deploy on their own systems, globally networked high-performance infrastructure, or a combination of both. Use of these cloud based services has been successful for a number of commercial applications, on each of the examined systems. 

None of the services covered are ideal in all circumstances, and the best system will differ based on the application that needs to be developed and deployed on the cloud. Google App Engine and Microsoft Azure offer specific Platforms for the quick development of applications best suited to their respective environments. Amazon EC2 provides the most flexibility in terms of the applications that can be developed in the other services are too restrictive, while Manjrasoft's Aneka aims to allow for simpler application development while allowing for great flexibility in terms of the applications that can be used.
