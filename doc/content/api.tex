\chapter{The Grid: API}
\label{thegrid:api}

Both the Web based User Interface and the Client application (Client.py) communicate with the master node of The Grid through a REST API. REST stands for Representational State Transfer and is becoming the de-facto standard for web based API's, such as those used by Twitter and Facebook. The key benefits to using this technology are that many tools exist for consuming these services; it works over HTTP enabling consumption of services on mobile devices and provides a consistent model to develop with.

Rather than using XML, we have chosen to use the JSON format. The primary driver for selecting JSON is its simplicity. XML can easily become cumbersome for development due to the challenges of maintaining XML schemas in a rapidly evolving development process. JSON is also extremely well supported within Python and Javascript which greatly simplified development.

The REST API is secured using based HTTP Authentication, preventing unauthorized access to The Grid.
