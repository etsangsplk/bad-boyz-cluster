\chapter{Future Improvements}
\label{futureimprovements}

There are a number of key improvments that could make The Grid much better.

\begin{itemize}
\item The use of SSL in order to secure the communication between The Master and The Nodes and The Clients.

\item The use of a proper job specification format that would allow the sending of non-self-contained executables around the heterogenous grid.

\item The use of a virtual file system that would allow better sandboxing of executables on The Grid.

\end{itemize}
