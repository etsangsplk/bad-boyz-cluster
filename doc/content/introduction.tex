\chapter{Introduction}
This report outlines the architecure, design and implementation details of The Grid, a distributed grid computing software package. The Grid allows for the distribution and exectution of self-contained executable files across a heterogenous grid, allowing users of the software to optimise the running of their jobs based on their deadline and any cost restraints. This software package includes a number of different scheduling algorithms that can be used depending on the type of jobs The Grid will be used for.
