\chapter{Evaluation}
We can evaluate the use of The Grid in order to schedule and manage parallelisable executables by performing a side-by-side comparison of The Grid and its various schedulers to running all of the jobs in a non-distributed manner.

\section{The Test}
\label{thetest}

The following Jobs were to be executed, and their results collected. For the sake of testing, it is assumed that all jobs were recieved at once.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\setlength{\tymax}{0.5\linewidth}
\centering

\begin{tabulary}{\textwidth}{@{}LLLL@{}} \toprule
Job ID&Wall Time&Deadline&\# Input Files\\

1&1:00:00&2 days&4\\
2&1:00:00:00&7 days&1\\
3&12:00:00&1 day&7\\

5&7:00:00:00&14 days&5\\

The following Nodes were available in The Grid.

\section{The Results}
\label{theresults}

\subsection{No Distribution}
\label{nodistribution}

With no distribution, all jobs would be executed on a single core on a single machine. This is provided at a baseline.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\setlength{\tymax}{0.5\linewidth}
\centering
\small
\begin{tabulary}{\textwidth}{@{}LLLLL@{}} \toprule
Job ID&Wait Time&Time Taken&Total Time&Made Deadline?\\
\midrule
1&00:00:00&4:00:00&4:00:00&Yes\\
2&04:00:00&1:00:00:00&1:04:00:00&Yes\\
3&1:04:00:00&3:12:00:00&4:16:00:00&No\\

\textbf{Total Time Taken:} 57 Days, 14 Hours

\subsection{FCFS}
\label{fcfs}

This is using the most naive of the distributed algorithms, First come first server. This provides a distributed baseline.
